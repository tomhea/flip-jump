"""
the pygame/SDL window host shared by the interactive io-devices, and the two devices that
use it.

PygameWindow owns the single SDL window and its event pump: it captures live key events
(into a queue), presents frames, toggles fullscreen on F11, and raises KeyboardInterrupt
when the window is closed (a clean run-termination). It is a *neutral* resource - the
interactive screen draws to it and the keyboard reads keys from it, but neither depends
on the other. PcIO.interactive() wires both onto the one window it creates, so it shows
the frames and captures the keys.

SDL only delivers key events to a focusable window, so capturing live keys needs one open.
In `pc` the screen opens+sizes the window on the program's init-screen command; for a window
with no screen to size it (e.g. standalone keyboard tests), ensure_open_for_input opens a
small default window.

keycodes delivered to the fj program (one byte): printable/control keys send their
ascii-like SDL keycode (k < 0x80, e.g. 'a'=97, esc=27, enter=13, space=32); the
arrows/shift/ctrl/alt send 0x80-0x86 (up,down,left,right,shift,ctrl,alt). other keys
are ignored. F11 is captured for the fullscreen toggle and is never delivered.

pygame is an optional dependency: `pip install flipjump[io]`. the window must be
driven from the main thread (a macOS/SDL requirement) - the interpreter already runs
there. works on Windows, Linux and macOS; tests run headless with SDL's dummy driver.
