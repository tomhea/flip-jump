"""
the device<->memory hook.
lets an IODevice read and write the interpreter memory by address during a run (e.g. a
screen device reading pixel data straight out of the program memory).

the interpreter attaches a DeviceMemory to the io-device (IODevice.attach_memory) right
before the run-loop starts - one adapter per engine (the python Reader / the native Memory).

addresses: read_word/write_word use word addresses (bit_address >> log2(w)). the
read_data_byte/write_data_byte helpers use the op-structured data convention instead: a
"packed byte" lives in the data bits (dbit..dbit+7, where dbit = w + #w) of one fj op -
bits #w..#w+7 of the op's jump word - so they take the op's (dw-aligned) bit-address
directly. (a hex.vec nibble is the low 4 of these bits; a packed byte is all 8.)
