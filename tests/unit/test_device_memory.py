unit-tests for the device<->memory hook.

an IODevice can be attached to the interpreter memory at run-start (attach_memory), and can
then read and write interpreter memory by address during the run - the screen device reads
data straight out of the program memory. pinned here over both the
pure-python and the native engine.
