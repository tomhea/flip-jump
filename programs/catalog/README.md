# FlipJump Demonstration Catalog

A catalog of small, working FlipJump programs that collectively demonstrate
the language can express anything: arithmetic, strings, bits, state machines,
puzzles, simulations, and more. Each program is self-contained, simple, and
fully tested.

## How to use this catalog

Each program lives at `programs/catalog/<category>/<slug>.fj`. Its input and
expected output live at `tests/inout/catalog/<category>/<slug>.in|.out`. Run
the whole catalog with:

```
pytest --catalog
```

Or run a single program directly:

```
fj programs/catalog/<category>/<slug>.fj
```

See [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) for the file format, naming rules, and
testing protocol.
